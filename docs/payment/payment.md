# Payment & Plans

You can pay for Errordeck with credit card. We use Paddle as our payment provider. Paddle is a trusted payment provider that is used by many companies. You can read more about Paddle [here](https://paddle.com/).

## Plans

We have plans based on the number of errors you want to track. You can see the plans [here](https://www.errordeck.com/pricing). The lowest plan is 10 EUR per month and it allows you to track 50,000 errors per month. The higher plans allow you to track more errors per month.

### How is the number of errors calculated

The number of errors is calculated based on the number of errors that are reported to Errordeck. If you have 1 error that is reported 100 times, it will count as 100 errors. If you have 100 errors that are reported 1 time, it will count as 100 errors. We have Spike detection that will detect spikes in the number of errors and will not count them. You can read more about Spike detection [here](/payment/spike-detection).

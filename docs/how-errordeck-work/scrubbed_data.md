# Scrubbed data 

We have this simple scrubler to help you out removing some personal information for you. It is meant to be used as a last resort.

We recommend you to always check and filter out personal data before sending us the events.

Here you can see what we check for, which can help you to see if we make a mistake on removing wrong or why it doesn't come out.
You can also give us feedback on this list through email.

These are checked and filter based on key value only:

* email
* name
* phone
* first_name
* last_name
* password
* password_confirmation
* password_digest

* cvv_code_number
* access_token
* api_key
* api_secret
* api_token
